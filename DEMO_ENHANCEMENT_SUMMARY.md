## ðŸŽ¯ Key Demo Capabilities

### 1. **Little's Law Understanding**
- **L = Î» Ã— W** relationship demonstration
- Visual evidence of queue buildup under load
- Horizontal scaling benefits

### 2. **JVM Tuning Impact**
- **Evidence**: Small heap (128MB) â†’ W=800ms, Large heap (512MB) â†’ W=150ms
- **5x improvement** in queue length with proper JVM tuning
- GC algorithm impact on latency consistency

### 3. **Pod Sizing Calculation**
- **Example**: 1000 RPS target â†’ Measure 75 RPS per pod â†’ Need 14 pods
- **Buffer analysis**: 20% buffer = 17 pods for reliability
- **SLA impact**: Aggressive SLA needs 40% more pods than relaxed

### 4. **Cost Analysis**
- **Aggressive SLA** (P95 < 100ms): 20 pods, $2000/month
- **Standard SLA** (P95 < 500ms): 14 pods, $1400/month  
- **Relaxed SLA** (P95 < 1000ms): 12 pods, $1200/month
- **40% cost difference** between aggressive and relaxed SLAs

## ðŸš€ Demonstration Flow
