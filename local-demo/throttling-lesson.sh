echo "------------------------------------"
echo "1. Proper Resource Sizing:"
echo "   ‚Ä¢ Monitor actual CPU usage patterns"
echo "   ‚Ä¢ Size containers based on peak demand + buffer"
echo "   ‚Ä¢ Use CPU requests vs limits appropriately"

echo "2. Application Optimization:"
echo "   ‚Ä¢ Implement circuit breakers"
echo "   ‚Ä¢ Use connection pooling"

echo "----------------------------------"
echo "Try these experiments to see different behaviors:"

echo "1. Change CPU limits:"
echo "   docker update --cpus='0.5' spring-1cpu  # More throttling"
echo "   docker update --cpus='2.0' spring-1cpu  # Less throttling"

echo "2. Monitor different metrics:"
echo "   docker exec spring-1cpu cat /sys/fs/cgroup/cpu.stat"
echo "   docker exec spring-1cpu cat /proc/loadavg"

echo "3. Test with VisualVM:"
echo "   ‚Ä¢ Connect to localhost:9998"
